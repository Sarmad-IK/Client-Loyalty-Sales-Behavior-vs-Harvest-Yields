# Client-Loyalty-Sales-Behavior-vs-Harvest-Yields

Team Members: Lokendra Singh Badgujar, Srujana Gali, Xingyu Yao, Sarmad Kahut

**Problem Definition:**

MyAgro works on improving the financial status of rural populations in Western Africa by providing mobile layaway, input delivery, and agricultural training to ensure better yields. Our goal is to find the relationship between client loyalty and their harvest yields. For example, for clients who were satisfied with the training module in the current season, did they get a high yield in the harvest seasons? If they did, would they buy more products in the next season?

**Motivation:**

We aim to achieve a number of things through this analysis;

- To evaluate the effectiveness of the program; how the program reduces financial burden while ensuring satisfaction among farmers.
- Understanding customer loyalty in a non-profit context and gauging the social impact of MyAgro.
